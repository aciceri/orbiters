### Updated in this project

- Read the app surfaces for the two application-variant options: PigroCRM Fatture and Nuovo cliente, hub admin lists and the member area.
- Recreated four working screens at 1440×900 in two options, "Ledger" (1px ink, ruled tables, 4px step) and "Paper" (2px ink, zebra, 6px step).
- Copy, columns, states and Italian formats lifted from the repo's own routes, columns and format helpers.
- Icon geometry copied from lucide (the set both apps import) rather than redrawn.
