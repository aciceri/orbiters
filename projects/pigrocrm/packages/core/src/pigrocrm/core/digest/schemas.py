"""One week of a space, as one object with no HTML in it (spec 2026-09-16 §3.2).

Pydantic and nothing else: the mail renders this (§3.5), the command prints it (§3.4),
and the tests read it. A schema that carried a fragment of markup would make the tests
assertions about a rendering, and the first change to the mail's telaio would break every
one of them.

**Every figure here arrives already computed.** Not one field is derived from another,
and the two properties at the bottom are predicates over fields rather than sums of them:
`DigestService` copies each number from the repository or the service that owns it, so
there is no second place a total of this report can be worked out and disagree. The same
rule `core/dashboard/` is held to by an AST scan, applied here by construction --
`vinto_da_fatturare` is the dashboard's own count, `valore_maturato` is
`AnalyticsService`'s, and the two month totals are two calls to one register sum with two
windows.

Italian field names, like every other schema in this package: the reader of the mail and
the reader of this file are the same person.
