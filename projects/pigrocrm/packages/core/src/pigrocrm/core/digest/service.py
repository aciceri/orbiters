"""Composition, and the three week helpers. Nothing here invents a figure.

Spec 2026-09-16 §3.2: `build` calls services and repositories that already own their
numbers and copies the answers into `WeeklyDigest`. The only sums in the whole report are
`InvoiceRepository`'s own -- `sum_emesse_in_periodo` twice with two windows for the two
months -- and they are that repository's, not this module's. The one arithmetic left here
is `giorni_di_ritardo`, `(today - scadenza).days`, which is not a figure but the same
subtraction `SollecitiService` prints on the same invoices. The discipline is the one
`core/dashboard/` is held to by an AST scan, and it matters more here than there: a mail
is read once, quickly, by somebody who will not go and check, so a figure that disagrees
with the screen is a figure that costs trust and is never noticed again.

**The order of `build` is load-bearing at exactly one point.**
`DashboardService.get_operational_dashboard` opens a read-only `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot
and *refuses* a session that already has a transaction in progress, so it has to be the
first read this method makes. Everything after it then runs inside that snapshot, which is
the property the report wants anyway: seven sections read at seven instants is how a mail
comes to say «2 fatture emesse» above a list of three.

The rest of the order is only the order of §3.1, so that reading this method and reading
the mail are the same walk.
