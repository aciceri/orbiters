"""The completion event the API sends on its own (REB-215): what it carries, whose it
is, and that nothing in it can fail an application.

The SDK is the only thing faked -- `Tracker` takes the `capture` callable -- because
the shape of the event is the part that is wrong in silence: a property misnamed here
is a funnel that quietly stops matching the browser's half.
