"""What PostHog's warehouse reads, asserted against the schema that feeds it.

On 2026-09-21 PostHog paused a sync with «something this sync depends on no longer
exists». It was ours: the identity merge renamed `member_logins` to `logins` (REB-281,
migration 0012). Nothing refused anybody -- a `GRANT` travels with a rename -- so the
suite was green, the deploy was green, and the only thing that noticed was an email from
PostHog nine days later.

This file is the thing that notices. It is the same shape as the website's
`path-map-plugin.test.ts`, which reads `deploy/nginx.conf` and compares it with the copy
the dev server uses: two copies of one fact, and a test that fails when they disagree.
Here the fact is the list of tables a machine outside this repository selects from, the
copies are `WAREHOUSE_TABLES` below and the runbook's own sentence, and the schema is the
third party to both.

It reads a file outside this project, which nothing else in `packages/core` does. The
import rule this repository enforces is about imports, and there is no module to import:
the list lives in prose because its reader is a console nobody here can call.
