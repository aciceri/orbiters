"""The digest's own event, sent by the server: `digest_inviato` (REB-221).

A space's browser reports very little of the CRM back to PostHog -- most of a working
day happens in Gmail, in a video call, in a PDF someone reads offline -- so the weekly
digest is one of the few signals the product gets about whether a space is actually
opening what it is mailed. It has to come from the server: the mail is generated and
sent by a background job with no browser attached to hand the event to, and a person
who never opens the mail leaves no client behind that could have sent it anyway.

**One person, one id.** This event is captured under `str(user_id)`, the same id the
browser uses once that person signs in (`shared/analytics`), so a digest sent and the
session it eventually leads to line up on one person rather than two. Unlike the hub's
`iscrizione_completata` (`projects/hub/packages/core/src/rebase_core/analytics.py`),
which anonymizes an applicant who may never become a person PostHog has profiled, a
digest recipient is always an existing, already-identified CRM user -- so this event
carries no `$process_person_profile: false`. Setting it here would suppress the very
profile the browser half is building.

**Nothing here can break the digest run.** `digest_sent` is called once the mail has
already been handed to the sender, a capture that raises answers `False`, and an empty
`PIGROCRM_POSTHOG_KEY` builds no client at all -- the same three guarantees
`pigrocrm_mcp.analytics` gives its own callers, and the same shape the hub's
`analytics.py` gives `iscrizione_completata`.
