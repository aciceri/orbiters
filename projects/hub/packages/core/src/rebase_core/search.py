"""Trigram search: an escaped `ILIKE` decides which rows match, `pg_trgm` similarity
decides the order among them (REB-285).

Reimplements natively, and far more narrowly, what PigroCRM's own search scores with
per-field weights and a similarity floor
(`projects/pigrocrm/packages/core/src/pigrocrm/core/search/scoring.py`) -- this package
may import neither adapter, and PigroCRM is neither (`projects/hub/AGENTS.md`, "the one
rule"). REB-285's own card asks for less than the CRM built: "no full-text ranking;
trigram similarity ordered by creation date is enough for a list an admin scans."

Matching and ordering are deliberately two different things. `matches_any` is an
`ILIKE '%term%'` across every searchable column -- accelerated by a `gin_trgm_ops`
index per column (migration 0013) -- and it is what decides whether a row is in the
result at all: a search for `"AI"` must still find "Miriai", and `similarity()` alone
would not, because a two-character term shares too few trigrams with a long field to
clear any threshold worth setting. `similarity_score` never filters; it only orders the
rows `matches_any` already chose, highest first, so a name that starts with the term
outranks one that merely contains it somewhere in the middle.

    that merely have *some* character in that position -- a correctness bug, not a SQL
    injection risk, since callers always bind the escaped term as a parameter and never
    interpolate it into SQL text.

    The backslash is escaped first, before "%" and "_": escaping either of those first
    would double-escape the backslashes that step introduces. Pass the result to
